## What is this extension?

Webtor-Zip-Fixer is a simple Chrome extension that fixes broken ZIP files downloaded from webtor.io. When you download ZIP files from webtor.io, they're usually corrupted and can't be extracted properly. This extension fixes that problem and generates healthy, extractable ZIP files with all directories intact.

## How does it work?

### Step 1: Finding the download link

### Step 2: Downloading the ZIP file
